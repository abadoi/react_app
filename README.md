# react_app

### Step 1

For the initial commit, I have created a simple ReactJs app using <code>create-react-app</code> from Facebook.
I also created a python Starlette API which is consumed by the fronted, displaying a simple message from the backend. ("Hello Andrei from backend")


### Step 2

For this step, I have created a PostegreSQL db and inserted the raw data. The backend is now fetching data directly from the DB and then sends it to the Frontend in json format. 5 different hard-coded gifs are mapped to the the data which is now displayed in the UI .


### Step 3

For this step we are talking about refining the UI and adding the extra-needed features.


### Step 4

Containerize the entire system using Docker.
